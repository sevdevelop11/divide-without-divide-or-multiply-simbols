# Division Without Symbols README

This repository contains code that performs division of two numbers without using the multiplication or division symbols. It's implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How it Works

The division algorithm implemented in this code relies on repeated subtraction. It repeatedly subtracts the divisor from the dividend until the remainder is less than the divisor. The number of subtractions performed is then counted, which represents the quotient.

## Usage

To use this code, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser, provide the dividend and divisor in the input fields, and click the "Divide" button. The quotient will be displayed.

## Example

Assuming you have opened `index.html` in a web browser:

- Input:
  - Dividend: 10
  - Divisor: 2

- Output:
  - Quotient: 5

## Files

- `index.html`: HTML file containing the user interface.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the division logic.

## Requirements

No additional requirements are needed to run this code apart from a web browser with JavaScript enabled.
